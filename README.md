# Advanced Python Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard

This repository contains the source code written during the live lesson covering this project.
It includes a variant of the starter code included in your project instructions. Key differences include:
1. The code is separated into two files:
   - main.py (For game flow logic.)
   - classes.py (For the Character class and its subclasses.)
2. An example class, Rogue, is included with a fully-coded special ability function.
3. An additional class, 'customfunctions.py' is included to showcase how you can import functions from a separate Python file. (This file is not needed for the project and you can delete it if you desire.)

NOTE: All classes from the classes.py file are imported into main.py on line 1.
Feel free to use this repository as starter code for your project if you prefer this setup.
